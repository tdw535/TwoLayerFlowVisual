# TwoLayerFlowVisual


The goal of the project is to have a nice visual display of
two layer flow (for shallow and deep) inside a browser
which will adjust the type of flow given the bounding box size
-----------------------

Personal goal is to learn more about WebAssembly and writing
C++ code that can be run inside the browser
