# Plan
- First get a basic pipeline working (or bash script) so that
the compiling c++, then converting to html is easy

 (Maybe using cmake?)


- Get a basic html template down that looks okay 

- Start writing the C++ engine for two layer flow

- Engine should use the linearized equations for now for simplicity

## Some thoughts

It would be nice if the computational engine was swappable
