# Plan

- First get a basic pipeline working (or bash script) so that
  the compiling c++, then converting to html is easy

(Maybe using cmake?)
Progress on cmake [---->xxxx] need to get the html working

- Need to work out the environment path (see emscripten documentation to make it work if not yet working)

- Need to make sure that all the build related stuff gets put in the build directory so that the main directory is not cluttered

- Get a basic html template down that looks okay

- Start writing the C++ engine for two layer flow

- Engine should use the linearized equations for now for simplicity

## Some thoughts

It would be nice if the computational engine was swappable
